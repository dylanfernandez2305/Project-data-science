# AI_USAGE.md — Use of AI Tools

## 1) Tools used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — primary writing assistant for LaTeX polishing, structure suggestions, methodology review, and code organization recommendations.
- **Claude (Anthropic)** — secondary tool for code review suggestions, LaTeX formatting, and small refactoring proposals.

## 2) Purpose and scope of use
AI tools were used to:
- **Code quality**: Debugging assistance, code review suggestions, naming conventions, refactoring patterns.
- **Learning**: Understanding Optuna, LaTeX formatting, scikit-learn conventions.
- **Documentation**: Writing docstrings, adding comments, improving code clarity.
- **Writing assistance**: Grammar corrections, sentence restructuring for clarity (without changing technical meaning), LaTeX formatting.

**Important distinction**: AI assisted with **linguistic form** (grammar, clarity, formatting) but **not with intellectual content** (research design, analysis, interpretation). All substantive technical content and scientific reasoning is the author's original work.

AI tools were NOT used to:
- Generate research ideas, hypotheses, or experimental design.
- Fabricate results or invent interpretations.
- Write substantive technical content beyond language refinement.

## 3) What AI contributed (concrete examples)

### Report writing
- **Before AI**: "The models were trained and we got good results."
- **After AI refinement**: "Supervised models demonstrate superior fraud detection when trained on labeled data with class weighting."
- Reformulated abstract for conciseness (reduced from ~250 to ~200 words).
- Suggested consistent terminology (e.g., "anomaly detection methods" instead of mixing "unsupervised models").

### Methodology improvements
- Identified potential data leakage risk when threshold optimization was initially planned on test set.
- Recommended strict validation/test separation with validation-only calibration.

### Code quality
- Recommended adding docstrings to `get_optimal_threshold_f1()` function.
- Suggested consistent naming convention (e.g., `_semi` suffix for semi-supervised models).

### LaTeX formatting
- Helped format complex tables with proper column alignment.
- Suggested using `\texttt{}` for code references and `\cite{}` for bibliography.
- Recommended figure placement with `[H]` for better control.

## 4) Critical evaluation and AI limitations
AI tools occasionally:
- Suggested overly verbose formulations that were simplified by the author.
- Proposed methodological approaches that required adaptation to the project context.
- Made minor factual errors that were corrected through manual verification.

All AI suggestions were critically evaluated and adapted before inclusion.

## 4) Verification and validation steps
To ensure correctness:
- All numerical values reported (dataset counts, metrics, AUC) were taken from program outputs generated by the final code version.
- Figures included in the report were generated by the project code; AI tools did not generate results.

## 5) Author's original contributions
The following elements are entirely the author's work:
- **Research design**: Definition of research questions, choice of models, and experimental protocol.
- **Implementation**: All Python code (data processing, model training, evaluation pipeline, visualization).
- **Experimentation**: Running all experiments, hyperparameter tuning, and generating all results.
- **Analysis**: Interpretation of results, identification of patterns, and drawing conclusions.
- **Figures and tables**: All figures and performance tables generated from author's code outputs.

AI tools assisted primarily with **linguistic refinement** and **methodological validation**, not with intellectual content creation.

## 6) Dates / notes (optional)
- Main usage period: [add your dates].
- Notes: [e.g., "used mainly for language polishing and methodology review"].

## 7) Final declaration
The author acknowledges AI assistance as a **writing and review tool** while affirming full responsibility for:
- The intellectual content and scientific contributions of this work
- The correctness of all reported results and interpretations
- The originality and integrity of the research methodology
- All code implementation and experimental outcomes

This disclosure is provided in the spirit of academic transparency and follows emerging best practices for AI tool usage in research contexts.
